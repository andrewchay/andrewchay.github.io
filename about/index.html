	<h1>My Background</h1>
	<p>
    I received my PhD in statistics in 2014 from <a href="https://stat.uiowa.edu/" style="color: #128ff0
">The University of Iowa. </a> After that, I did my two-year post-doctoral training at <a href="www.yale.edu" style="color: #128ff0">Yale University. </a> During those years, most of my work focused on statistical inference in high-dimensional models, and developing statistical methodologies in analyzing epigenetics data. Now I am working at a leading biotech company as a senior biostatistician. In my spare time, I like reading, watching reality shows and all kinds of sports!
  </p>
  <p>
    I love statistics and machine learning. Specifically I am really interested in random forrest, boosting, deep learning, and unsupervised clustering such as kmeans or spectral clustering.
